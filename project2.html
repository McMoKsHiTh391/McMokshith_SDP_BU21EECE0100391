        <h1>Experience in Evaluating Modulation Schemes in GNU Radio</h1>
        <p>I have conducted comprehensive evaluations of various modulation schemes, focusing on their performance in different scenarios. These schemes include AM (Amplitude Modulation), FM (Frequency Modulation), PM (Phase Modulation), and advanced methods like SSB-SC (Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier), DSB-SC (Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier), and VSB-SC (Vestigial Sideband Suppressed Carrier). Here's an overview of my findings:</p>
        <h4>AM Transmitter and Receiver:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Advantages: Simple design, cost-effective, and widely used in broadcasting.</li>
            <li>Performance: Susceptible to noise and interference; requires more bandwidth compared to SSB-SC.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>FM Transmitter and Receiver:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Advantages: Better noise immunity and improved sound quality over AM.</li>
            <li>Performance: Requires a larger bandwidth but provides better fidelity and is less prone to signal degradation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>PM Modulation and Demodulation:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Advantages: Similar noise immunity to FM, used in digital applications.</li>
            <li>Performance: More complex circuitry than AM and FM, but offers robustness in digital communications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>SSB-SC (Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Advantages: Efficient bandwidth usage, reduced power consumption.</li>
            <li>Performance: Better performance in long-distance communication with less interference and reduced bandwidth requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            DSB-SC (Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier):
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Advantages: Improved bandwidth efficiency over AM.</li>
            <li>Performance: Requires precise carrier synchronization at the receiver, making the system more complex.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>VSB-SC (Vestigial Sideband Suppressed Carrier):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Advantages: Combines the benefits of SSB and DSB, used in TV broadcasting.
            </li>
            <li>Performance: Efficient bandwidth usage and better performance in video signal transmission with partial suppression of one sideband</li>
        </ul>
